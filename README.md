# EasterTimer

Basic Easter Countdown application for the wife.

Uses the Angular framework and Rust (webassembly) for scripture verses and calculating Resurrection Sunday each year.

Only works until 2098, after which the math changes and I won't be here to fix it.

Hope you have a wonderful Easter celebrating the death and resurrection of our Wonderful Saviour - The Lord Jesus Christ.
